# datatablesjs-sample
A code sample that goes hand-in-hand with the blog post <a href="https://wp.me/p5pqHU-u5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.

This represents an IIFE module that wraps the registration/configuration of table HTML elements as fully-fledged 'data tables', as created by the <a href="https://datatables.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DataTables</a> library.

Two sample HTML files are included to illustrate how the module functions from the perspective of a multi-table setup and a tabbed configuration. Datatables.js and jQuery are tied together here. In addition, Bootstrap is utilised for basic styling (and it's tabbing support, for demo purposes).

Further details can be found in the indicated blog post.
